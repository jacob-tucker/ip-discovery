## About Story Protocol

Story Protocol is an open standard and protocol for defining the attribution and usage permissions of intellectual property (IP), similar to how the Internet Protocol (IP) standardized the transmission of data packets.

By leveraging blockchain technology, Story Protocol ensures transparent and immutable records of IP ownership and usage rights, creating new opportunities for creators in the digital economy.
